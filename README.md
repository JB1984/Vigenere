# Vigenere
Program to decrypt/encrypt a passage using Vigenere cipher technique. 

Just run the file and it will prompt you to make a choice betweeen encrypting or decrypting

In both the encrypting or decrypting choice you will see the following input questions:

<b>The first keyword</b>, which creates the alphabet "top" line. This currently must contain only one instance of each letter of the alphabet. For example you can use "Hi" but not "Hello" since "Hello" has two l's. 

<b>The second keyword</b>, which creates the lines undeaneath the top line. This creates the "matrix" used. You can use any word here, it can contain more than one instance of a letter. So you could use "Hello" here.

<b>The passage to encrypt/decrypt</b>.

I would suggest you try first doing something where you know the keys, as well as the encrypted decrypted passes. Something like the first Kryptos passage (K1) which is:

<H4> ENCRYPT </H4>

First Key: KRYPTOS <br>
Second Key: PALIMPSEST <br>
Enter passage you wish to encrypt: Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the nuance of iqlusion

Encrypted passage you should get returned: EMUFPHZLRFAXYUSDJKZLDKRNSHGNFIVJYQTQUXQBQVYUVLLTREVJYQTMKYRDMFD <br>
