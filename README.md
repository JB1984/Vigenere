# Vigenere
Program to decrypt/encrypt a passage using Vigenere cipher technique. Right now it is only setup to decrypt.

Just run the file and it will prompt you for:

The first keyword, which creates the alphabet "top" line

The second keyword, which creates the lines undeaneath the top line. This creates the "matrix" used

The encrypted passage, this will then be decrypted.

Since at the moment you can only decrypt i would suggest testing it using a known combo of all these three things. Something like the first Kryptos passage (K1) which is:

First Key: KRYPTOS <br>
Second Key: PALIMPSEST <br>
Encrypted Passage: EMUFPHZLRFAXYUSDJKZLDKRNSHGNFIVJYQTQUXQBQVYUVLLTREVJYQTMKYRDMFD <br>

Your decrypted passage should be "Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the nuance of iqlusion." Of course it will all be one long string, but you should still be able to read it.
